## Log

### R1D1 - 04/04/2018
Working through the freeCodeCamp jQuery challenges!

### R1D2 - 05/04/2018
Working on my [tribute page](https://codepen.io/nimbus117/full/bvxgmO/) for the "Basic Front End Development Projects" from freeCodeCamp. Trying to use all I've learnt from the previous challenges and take it a bit further.

### R1D3 - 06/04/2018
Working on my [personal portfolio](https://codepen.io/nimbus117/full/zWmqNj/) for the "Basic Front End Development Projects" from freeCodeCamp. Watched the [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pD5KUE) videos on bootstrap 4 for ideas.

### R1D4 - 07/04/2018
2 hours of ruby at the [codeclan](https://codeclan.com) weekend taster session. Will definitely be applying to the 16 week course soon.

Exported my personal portfolio from [codepen](https://codepen.io) and followed [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) to host it in AWS S3.

### R1D9 - 14/04/2018

All of freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges done except the last one "Caesars Cipher". Spent some time on it but getting nowhere! My brains stopped working and it's time to head out. Will pick up tomorrow.

### R1D10 - 18/04/2018

Finally finished the freeCodeCamp "Caesars Cipher" challenge. Originally used a for loop but after checking the hints .map made more sense. Started working through "JSON APIs and Ajax"

### R1D13 - 25/04/2018

Working on the freeCodeCamp local weather challenge. Used jQuery to get the location and then used the freeCodeCamp weather api to get the local weather. Still to do: style the page a bit, add button to toggle between fahrenheit and celsius, add else to warn if location not available.

### R1D14 26/04/2018

[Show Local Weather Complete](https://codepen.io/nimbus117/full/MGebmP/)

Worked on the freeCodeCamp Wikipedia viewer, spent a good hour just trying to figure out the API but got it working in the end!

### R1D16 28/04/2018

Took a break from freeCodeCamp and worked on my personal site. Changed the layout a bit and added an image to the about section. Lot's of playing around with bootstrap and little styling changes.

### R1D17 29/04/2018

Continued work on my personal site. Used some string literals to create a template for modals and javascript objects to store the data. Took me hours to get right but quite chuffed it worked in the end.

### R1D18 30/04/2018

Working on the wikipedia viewer. Spent a good while trying to figure out the wikipedia api.

Working on the twitch api challenge. Javascript callbacks were confusing until grasping they're asynchronous.

Working on the twitch api challenge. Lots of playing around with bootstrap buttons and tabs and really used the chrome DevTools for the first time for JS errors and working out margins and padding.

Another late night sitting around waiting for upgrades while Working through the freeCodeCamp challenges. The Roman numeral converter took quite a while!

### R1D26 08/05/2018

Slow one today. Watched a few of [these](https://scrimba.com/g/gintrotocss) css videos. I really like the [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com) player interface, the fact you can edit the code during the video is so usefull for testing your understanding.

Also played around with my site some more, changed to using css variables for colors and created my own button rather than using bootstrap.
