# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [nimbus117]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [April 04, Wednesday, 2018].

## Log

### R1D1 - 04/04/2018
Working through the freeCodeCamp jQuery challenges!

### R1D2 - 05/04/2018
Working on my [tribute page](https://codepen.io/nimbus117/full/bvxgmO/) for the "Basic Front End Development Projects" from freeCodeCamp. Trying to use all I've learnt from the previous challenges and take it a bit further.

### R1D3 - 06/04/2018
Working on my [personal portfolio](https://codepen.io/nimbus117/full/zWmqNj/) for the "Basic Front End Development Projects" from freeCodeCamp. Watched the [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pD5KUE) videos on bootstrap 4 for ideas.

### R1D4 - 07/04/2018
2 hours of ruby at the [codeclan](https://codeclan.com) weekend taster session. Will definitely be applying to the 16 week course soon.

Exported my personal portfolio from [codepen](https://codepen.io) and followed [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) to host it in AWS S3.

### R1D5 - 08/04/2018

Working through the basic JavaScript challenges from freeCodeCamp

### R1D6 - 09/04/2018

Finished the freeCodeCamp "basic JavaScript" and "Object Oriented and Functional Programming" challenges!

### R1D7 - 10/04/2018

Working through the freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges.

### R1D8 - 11/04/2018

Still working through the freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges. Repeated a few of them and tried different ways to achieve the same thing to make sure I actually understood what was happening.

### R1D9 - 14/04/2018

All of freeCodeCamp Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges done except the last one "Caesars Cipher". Spent some time on it but getting nowhere! My brains stopped working and it's time to head out. Will pick up tomorrow.

### R1D10 - 18/04/2018

Finally finished the freeCodeCamp "Caesars Cipher" challenge. Originally used a for loop but after checking the hints .map made more sense. Started working through "JSON APIs and Ajax"

### R1D11 - 22/04/2018

Finished JSON APIs and Ajax, started on the Random Quote Machine

### R1D12 - 24/04/2018

[Random Quote Machine complete](https://codepen.io/nimbus117/full/LmNyZV/)

### R1D13 - 25/04/2018

Working on the freeCodeCamp local weather challenge. Used jQuery to get the location and then used the freeCodeCamp weather api to get the local weather. Still to do: style the page a bit, add button to toggle between fahrenheit and celsius, add else to warn if location not available.

### R1D14 26/04/2018

[Show Local Weather Complete](https://codepen.io/nimbus117/full/MGebmP/)

### R1D15 27/04/2018

Worked on the freeCodeCamp Wikipedia viewer, spent a good hour just trying to figure out the API but got it working in the end!

### R1D16 28/04/2018

Took a break from freeCodeCamp and worked on my personal site. Changed the layout a bit and added an image to the about section. Lot's of playing around with bootstrap and little styling changes.

### R1D16 29/04/2018

Continued work on my personal site. Used some string literals to create a template for modals and javascript objects to store the data. Took me hours to get right but quite chuffed it worked in the end.
