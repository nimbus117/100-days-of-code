## Log

### R1D1 - 04/04/2018
Working through the freeCodeCamp jQuery challenges!

### R1D2 - 05/04/2018
Working on my [tribute page](https://codepen.io/nimbus117/full/bvxgmO/) for the "Basic Front End Development Projects" from freeCodeCamp. Trying to use all I've learnt from the previous challenges and take it a bit further.

### R1D3 - 06/04/2018
Working on my [personal portfolio](https://codepen.io/nimbus117/full/zWmqNj/) for the "Basic Front End Development Projects" from freeCodeCamp. Watched the [scrimba.com](https://scrimba.com/playlist/pD5KUE) videos on bootstrap 4 for ideas.

### R1D4 - 07/04/2018
2 hours of ruby at the [codeclan](https://codeclan.com) weekend taster session. Will definitely be applying to the 16 week course soon.

Exported my personal portfolio from [codepen](https://codepen.io) and followed [this guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) to host it in AWS S3.
